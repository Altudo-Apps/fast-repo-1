- Implement proper field rendering patterns
- Handle page modes (editing, Design Library, preview)

### 3. **Test-Driven Development**
- Write comprehensive unit tests
- Mock Content SDK appropriately
- Test both happy path and edge cases

### 4. **Responsive & Accessible**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes

### 5. **Performance Optimization**
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Efficient re-rendering patterns
- Bundle size optimization
